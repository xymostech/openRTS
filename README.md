## OpenRTS
#### Open Source Real Time Strategy Server

---
OpenRTS is an implementation of a server for a Real-Time Strategy game. It will include documentation of all protocols of communication between the server and client.

I am designing this server in order to implement an AI that controls the units in a real-time strategy game. Thus, many of the commands to issue are very simplified from their cooresponding commands in many RTS's. For example, the move command tells a unit to move in a direction, but no pathfinding takes place, and if a unit hits an obstacle it will stop.
